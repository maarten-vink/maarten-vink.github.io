I am a political scientist by training and interested in everything related to citizenship. I hold the Chair in Citizenship Studies and direct the Global Citizenship research area within the [Global Governance Programme](https://globalgovernanceprogramme.eui.eu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the [Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/robert-schuman-centre-for-advanced-studies){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the [European University Institute](www.eui.eu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

Together with [Rainer Bauböck](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=rainer-baubock){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Jelena Džankić](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=jelena-dzankic){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Jo Shaw](https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/people/professor-jo-shaw){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I co-direct the [Global Citizenship Observatory (GLOBALCIT)](www.globalcit.eu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a research network and open access resource committed to fact-based and non-partisan analysis of citizenship laws and electoral rights around the world.

I am currently on leave from Maastricht University where I am a Professor of Political Sociology and was one of the founders of the [Maastricht Center for Citizenship, Migration and Development](https://macimide.maastrichtuniversity.nl){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

Between 2016 and 2021, I led the research project [Migrant Life Course and Legal Status Transition (MiLifeStatus)](https://www.milifestatus.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} funded by a Consolidator Grant of the European Research Council. 

I use my [github repository](https://github.com/maarten-vink){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to post code you can use to replicate mainly descriptive exercises playing with data on the global regulation of citizenship (eg from [GLOBALCIT](www.globalcit.eu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) as well on statistics of citizenship acquisition (eg from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).
